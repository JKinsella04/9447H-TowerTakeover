/* 
  In the include folder we will put header files (files ending in .h) that are used to take the functions out of the main file and separate them into their own files for the purpose of making the main file smaller to avoid tiny common mistakes. To make the header files work we will do #include"HeaderFileName.h" in the main file so we can call them whenever and wherever we want to in the main file.
